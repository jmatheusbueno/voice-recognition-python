# voice-recognition-python
 A small project to test speech recognition using python.

* The program will use the system's standard mic device.
* The recognized standard language is pt-BR, but this can be changed in the method parameters recognize_google()

```python
#Archive Voice_Recognition.py, Line 14.
text = r.recognize_google(audio, language='pt-BR')
```
